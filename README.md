# NodeDashboard

The purpose of this project is to create a home page that I can use for whatever I need at the time. Notifications, Emails, Calendars, Events, Requests, and things to tackle are what I need to be able to see and keep track of on a daily basis. I want to make this project to make it easy to complete these things. My ultimate goal at the end is to push this onto a touch screen monitor in a room, for easy organization of daily tasks and keep monitor of the things that I care about.

I want this software to be free to use for anyone to edit and enhance. I believe that a home dashboard is different for everyone and we all need something different on our front page.

**Usage:**
1. On a web browser you may login/register from the link at the upper right corner. 
2. Once logged in, your password in encrypted and your browser is given an access token for this website.
3. With your access token you can start creating a dashboard using the keys at the bottom right. 

**Usable Settings:**
1. _Google Calendars_: These will be used for the Calendar widget. Any Calendar used here must be a public calendar. Further enhancemenets will be made int the future to use a google user/password and get all calendards
